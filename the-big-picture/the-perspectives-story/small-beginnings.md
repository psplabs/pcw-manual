# Small Beginnings

## Small Beginnings

The Perspectives program began as a response to the large number of students responding to the call at the 1973 Urbana student mission conference. Dr. Winter said, Every major decision a student makes will be faulty until they begin to see the whole world as God sees it.

So, he put together a course called the “Summer Institute of International Studies” and invited students from the Urbana to attend in the summer of 1974.
