## Introduction

In 1886, D.L. Moody invited 251 students to a month-long Bible conference.  By the Spirit’s work, two years later the Student Volunteer Movement was founded.

In 1914, 40,000 students were participating in global discipleship courses. These students fueled the Student Volunteer Movement that sent 20,000 young people across the globe in the Second Era of modern missions expansion. Ultimately, 100,000 were mobilized and one out of five went to the field. 

**The importance of a discipleship course that advances the movement of God’s people to the nations cannot be overestimated!**

The "world Christian movement" is much older and much broader than the Perspectives program and Perspectives is not the only discipleship course that God uses to advance His Kingdom.  Kairos, Pathways to Global Understanding, Operation Worldview and others have their strategic parts to play. 

**Perspectives is one of the most comprehensive courses available and has a proven track record mobilizing individuals, churches and organizations to be more strategic in how they engage in the world Christian movement.** Perspectives is a movement, a movement of multiplying classes, that is part of the World Christian Movement.  The Perspectives story as well as your story, is part of the larger story that God is writing in our time and will bring to completion when Jesus comes again in glory!!
